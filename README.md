The purpose of this app is to create a webpage that is based on two databases.

A static database that contains information relating to attractions around Cleveland.
An updatable database for user review submissions.

When a user loads the webpage they will see a navbar allowing them to travel to the different catagories and the top X results for most popular attractions.

Each attraction will have a clickable title to route the user to it's individual page, a brief desciption, a picture, a like button that will increment the attraction in the database, and a submit review button that will be tied to a database that will be associated with each attraction.
